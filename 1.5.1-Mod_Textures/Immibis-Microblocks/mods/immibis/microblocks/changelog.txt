54.0.3:
* Fixed breaking a microblock not causing a block update (allowing things like floating torches).
* Fixed the incompatibility with Buildcraft.

54.0.2:
* Maybe fixed the crash with Buildcraft installed.

54.0.1:
* Fixed upside-down textures on sides.
* Fixed names.
* Textures on all sides are displayed the same way as in normal blocks - none are flipped horizontally.
* Fixed some lighting differences between microblocks and normal blocks. Still no smooth lighting.

54.0.0:
* Updated to Minecraft 1.5.1.

53.0.0:
* Fixed wrong name in mod list.
* Updated to Minecraft 1.5.
* New bug: when breaking a microblock, particles have "missing texture" texture.

52.1.3:
* Added AE colourless cable to default tile entity list. Class is appeng.me.tile.TileColorlessCable

52.1.2:
* Refactored microblock API again - required update.
* Fixed a bug with config generation the first time you open Minecraft.
* Fixed mod page crash with NEI?

52.1.1:
* Added config option to hide microblocks from NEI, because I'm told ChickenBones still hasn't fixed the lag.
* Might fix not being able to mark Forestry planks as cuttable.

52.1.0:
* Fixed bottom and sides of microblocks not being darker than the top.
* Fixed transformed blocks being black in inventories.
* Config format changed and config file renamed to immibis-microblocks.cfg.
  Existing configs will be automatically converted.
* Changed the way autoDetectCuttableBlocks works.
* Added manual cuttableBlock list in config.
* Added support for mods that mix coverable and non-coverable tile entities in the same block ID (eg Applied Energistics)
* Added the following Applied Energistics blocks to the default list: ME Cable, ME Export Bus, ME Import Bus, ME Level Emitter,
  ME Storage Bus, ME Dark Cable.
  With the Export Bus, Import Bus and Storage Bus you can place covers on the same side the bus is on, causing flickering.
  So don't do that if it annoys you.
* You can no longer craft a microblock by itself to get the same one back.

52.0.9:
* Fixed flickering on overlapping microblocks with the same texture (yay!)
  They still flicker if the overlapping microblocks have different textures.
* Fixed some stacking issues.

52.0.8:
* Included microblock API in this jar file, as well as immibis core (as I can't remove it from there until 1.5).
  Maybe this fixes the IC2 load order problem.

52.0.7:
* Re-added IC2 cables to the default list of blocks to affect.

52.0.6:
* Probably fixed NPE when loading a world or connecting to a server.
* New handsaw sprite from Kaza, slightly modified (just the blade). Thanks Kaza!

52.0.5:
* Fixed dupe bug with Buildcraft pipes.
* Fixed selection boxes not rendering.
* Fixed placement ghosts not rendering.

52.0.3:
* Middle-clicking a microblock placed on a cable/conduit/liquiduct/pipe in creative will select the microblock, instead of the thing it's on.
* You can place torches, etc, attached to microblocks on cables/conduits/liquiducts/pipes.

52.0.0:
* Separated microblocks into a separate coremod like they should have been from the start.
  You don't need to update configs. You do need to download Immibis's Microblocks if you
  had microblocks enabled, or they will disappear from the world.
  The API is still in Immibis Core.
